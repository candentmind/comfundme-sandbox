                    <p><strong>A. Introduction</strong></p>
                    <p>This section contains information about our website and the fundraising platform we provide. It also explains how to access and register with the website and provides links to our policies and guidelines. These apply to your use of this website including the types of content you are permitted to post, the types of campaigns and related rewards we permit you to offer and what we do with any personal information we collect as you use this website.</p>
                    <p>Please note that we do not offer regulated investments through the platform, neither are Community Members allowed to do so. Therefore, we are not authorised or regulated by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). For the purpose of clarity, fundraising on the ComFundMe is only for social causes and may not be used for funding businesses, savings, raising capital or any form of investment. Any person, group or organization that violates this provision is liable to be reported to the appropriate agency and could be liable for prosecution.</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong> Welcome</strong></li>
                    </ol>
                    <p><strong>1.1</strong>&nbsp;Welcome to ComFundMe. The www.comfundme.com website and all other websites in the ComFundMe family of websites and the services provided through them (collectively, &ldquo;<strong>comfundme.com</strong>&rdquo;) are operated and owned by Techvibes International Limited (&ldquo;we&rdquo;, &ldquo;us&rdquo; or &ldquo;our&rdquo; as appropriate). For further information about us and our contact details, please visit the&nbsp;<a href="https://comfundme.com/about">About Us</a>&nbsp;page and see paragraph 11 of Section E,&nbsp;<a href="https://comfundme.com/contact">Contact us</a>&nbsp;below.</p>
                    <p><strong>1.2</strong>&nbsp;We may make our services available through a number of channels. They are currently available through comfundme.com.</p>
                    <p><strong>1.3&nbsp;</strong>To make these Terms quicker to read, we use a few key definitions: we refer to Community Members (as defined below) that are seeking to raise funds as &ldquo;<strong>Campaign Organisers</strong>&rdquo;, their fundraising projects as &ldquo;<strong>Campaigns</strong>&rdquo;, the aims of a Campaign as its &ldquo;<strong>Campaign Goal</strong>&rdquo;, Community Members and guests that support those Projects by contributing funds as &ldquo;<strong>Contributors</strong>&rdquo;, their contributions as &ldquo;<strong>Pledges</strong>&rdquo;, the minimum total value of Pledges sought by a Campaign Organiser for a particular Project as the &ldquo;<strong>Funding Target</strong>&rdquo;, the maximum period for which Pledges can be made for a Project as the &ldquo;<strong>Fundraising Period</strong>&rdquo; and the total value of Pledges (excluding cancelled Pledges) that a Project has received at the end of the Fundraising Period as &ldquo;<strong>Total Pledges</strong>&rdquo;. Community Members and other visitors to comfundme.com are referred to as &ldquo;<strong>Users,</strong>&rdquo; <strong>&ldquo;Guests&rdquo;</strong> or &ldquo;<strong>you</strong>&rdquo;, as applicable.&nbsp;</p>
                    <p><strong>1.4&nbsp;</strong>We provide a platform for individuals and organisations registered with comfundme.com (&ldquo;<strong>Community Members</strong>&rdquo;) to raise funds for causes that benefit themselves, others or their communities. The platform allows Campaign Organisers to promote their campaigns as best they can.</p>
                    <p><strong>1.5&nbsp;</strong>These Terms of Use are organised into 5 sections. Those in this Section A and in Section E apply to all Users, whether Community Members or those just visiting. Those in Sections B and C apply specifically to Campaign Organisers and those in Section D apply to all Community Members.</p>
                    <p><strong>1.6</strong>&nbsp;You will see that each section of these Terms of Use begins with a &lsquo;highlight&rsquo; text box which summarises the key terms in that section. These highlights are an informal summary and do not form part of the contract between us.</p>
                    <p><strong>1.7</strong>&nbsp;Please read these Terms carefully before you start to use comfundme.com, as they will govern your use of comfundme.com, the Projects that you create and offer as a Campaign Organiser and the Pledges you make as a Donor, as well as the content you post as a Community Member. We recommend that you print or save a copy of these Terms for future reference.</p>
                    <p><strong>1.8</strong>&nbsp;By using comfundme.com, you confirm that you accept these Terms and that you agree to comply with them. If you are using comfundme.com in connection with your organisation, the terms 'you', 'your' or 'your organisation' in these Terms are also a reference to the business, charity institution or other organisation or entity (&ldquo;<strong>Business</strong>&rdquo;) on whose behalf you act when using, registering, funding or creating a Campaign/Project on comfundme.com. If you do not want to be bound (or your Business to be bound, where applicable) by these Terms please do not access, use and/or contribute any content to comfundme.com or interact with its Community Members.</p>

                    <p><strong>B. Creating Campaigns and making Pledges.</strong></p>
                    <p>This section sets out the terms that apply to the projects that you create and the pledges or other contributions you make in support of projects.</p>

                        <li><strong> Our role</strong></li>
                    </ol>
                    <p><strong>1.1 What we do</strong></p>
                    <p><strong>1.1.1&nbsp;</strong>We provide an &lsquo;online meeting place&rsquo; and platform through which Community Members can raise finance for their social projects or causes. By providing this platform, together with crowdfunding tips and guidance, we facilitate agreement between Campaign Organisers Donors for Pledges, subject always to these Terms; &lsquo;ground rules&rsquo; that we put in place to act as safeguards for the benefit of all Community Members.</p>
                    <p><strong>1.1.2</strong>&nbsp;Although we may from time to time agree to promote and advertise certain Campaigns or help to raise awareness of their Project Goals, we will not be involved in the management of or use of Pledges in relation to a Campaign.</p>
                    <p><strong>1.1.3</strong>&nbsp;We shall ensure all Pledges made in relation to Campaigns are appropriately processed and transferred to the Bank account of the organisers no later than 48 hours after the agreed time period.</p>
                    <p><strong>1.1.4</strong>&nbsp;We shall ask all Donors making Pledges to confirm that they accept responsibility for ascertaining the true nature of any campaigns they are contributing to.</p>
                    <p><strong>1.1.5</strong>&nbsp;We shall ask all Campaign Organisers to confirm that the campaigns they are raising funds for are legal in nature.</p>
                    <p><strong>1.2 What we don&rsquo;t do</strong></p>
                    <p><strong>1.2.1</strong>&nbsp;Other than as mentioned above, we do not have any involvement in any arrangements Community Members make with each other through comfundme.com. We therefore do not accept any responsibility for the nature or quality of a Campaign/Project, nor do we promise that any Community Member, whether Campaign Organiser or Donor, will do as they promise. The arrangements you make are solely private and the contracts relating to Projects, Campaigns and Pledges, are made directly between the individual parties concerned. Accordingly, when using comfundme.com, you take full responsibility for your arrangements with other Community Members whom you contact and the nature, terms and extent of your arrangements with them and obligations to them.</p>
                    <p><strong>1.2.2&nbsp;</strong>We do not verify the identity of everyone who becomes a Community Member nor the information they provide about their Campaign/Project. We cannot therefore give any guarantee that any of the Community Members are who they say they are or that the information they provide is accurate, complete or true. Consequently, we make no recommendation or representations in relation to any Community Members or their Campaigns/Projects.</p>

                    <ol start="2">
                        <li><strong> Campaign Organisers</strong></li>
                    </ol>
                    <p><strong>2.1 Creating and updating Projects</strong></p>
                    <p><strong>2.1.1&nbsp;</strong>Once you have registered as a Community Member, you can create and post details of your Campaign to a publicly accessible webpage on comfundme.com (&ldquo;Campaign Profile Page&rdquo;) using the functionality we provide.</p>
                    <p><strong>2.1.2</strong>&nbsp;We have specific rules regarding the types of campaigns that you can post on comfundme.com.</p>
                    ComFundMe's mission is to tackle society's challenges by gathering support for causes through community effort. Our aim is to help projects and causes that matter get support from people who care.
                    ComFundMe supports the principles of freedom of speech, tolerance and inclusivity.&nbsp;
                    <p>While we recognise that some projects may become the subject of public debate, it is primarily for the crowd to decide which projects will get their funding and support.
                        ComFundMe will not, however, host projects where the act of raising funds or the purpose of the project is illegal under Nigerian law.</p>
                    <p><strong>2.1.3</strong>&nbsp;You may not raise funds via another online crowdfunding or similar platform (whether website or app) during the Funding Period of your Project and all Pledges from Community Members must be made through comfundme.com. Otherwise, unless we specifically agree an exclusive arrangement with you in writing, you are not obliged to raise funds for your Project exclusively via comfundme.com which means you are free to raise funds using other means and channels and source of finance.</p>
                    <p><strong>2.1.4</strong>&nbsp;Although we recommend you have no more than one active Project at any one time, we permit you to post as many active Projects as you like.</p>
                    <p><strong>2.1.5</strong>&nbsp;There is no limit on the Funding Target you select for each Campaign.</p>
                    <p><strong>2.1.6</strong>&nbsp;When submitting details of your Project, you will be presented with three funding options, as follows:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>&lsquo;All Or Nothing&rsquo;&nbsp;</strong>&ndash; if you choose this option when listing your Project, we will only distribute funds to you if you reach your Fundraising Target. If you do not reach your Fundraising Target, all Pledges and tips will be returned to Donors.</li>
                        <li><strong>&lsquo;Sweep What Is Raised&rsquo;</strong>&ndash; if you choose this option when listing your Project, we will distribute funds to you at the end of the Fundraising Period regardless whether any Fundraising Target has been reached.&nbsp;This option ,ay also be used for periodic sweeps.</li>
                        <li><strong>&lsquo;Forever Funding&rsquo;</strong>&ndash; if you choose this option your Project will stay open to receive Pledges on a continuous basis (but at a minimum for the Fundraising Period below) and we will transfer funds to you on an agreed periodic basis.&nbsp;</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>2.1.7</strong>&nbsp;The minimum Fundraising Period that you can choose for your Project is 28 days and the maximum is 12 months.</p>
